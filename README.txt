# Blockchain Foundations Project

The Blockchain Foundations Project is a simple blockchain for experimental
purposes. It is built to test different features and functions of blockchain
development. The blockchain itself is documented according to Google Python
standards, allowing a clean approach to learning about what each part of a
proof-of-work blockchain contributes.

## Features
  - Sha256 cryptographic data encryption
  - Proof-of-work validation of blocks
  - FastAPI localhost display of essential commands for testing

## Installation

1. Download the Blockchain Foundations Project from GitHub.
2. Unzip the .zip file to access the folder for the program.
3. Copy the file path for the folder.
4. Navigate to the file path using `cd YOUR_FILEPATH`.
5. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Launch the program using `uvicorn main:app --reload`
7. Navigate in any browser to *localhost:8000/docs* to use the program.


## Concepts for future development

Since this program is a very simple blockchain, there are a number of potential
expansions which when implemented will enhance the quality of the blockchain:

  - **Storage** of blockchain data **in json files**
  - Development of a **Proof of Stake** (PoS) system to validate the blockchain
  - Add further advanced security to the Blockchain
  - Cryptocurrency/token using the Foundational Blockchain as an experiment
  - Untraceable cryptocurrency/token security
